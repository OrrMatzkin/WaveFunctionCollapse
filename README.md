## About the project


This project is my implementation of the "Wave Function Collapse" algorithm.
The program is designed to generate an output pattern of arbitrary size, 
given a small image as its input, such that at any small enviroment in the 
output image, there is a resemblance to the input image. 

This implementation of the algorithm is written with functional programming 
design in mind, and enables runtime rendering of the collapse process, 
pattern extraction and viewing (unrelated to the actual algorithm run), and 
saving the result of each algorithm run both as an image of the final 
product and as a video of the collapse process itself.

## Requirements

jukebox requires the followin to run:

- Python 3.7.3+
  - python-vlc 3.0.12118+
  - adafruit-io 2.5.0+
- VLC media player 3.0.12+
- Adafruit IO Account 
- IFTT Account
- Google Assistance (Any access)

<p align="right">(<a href="#about-the-project">back to top</a>)</p>

## Getting Started

Disclaimer: There is quite a lot of things that jukebox needs for running, and there is more then one way to configure it. This is how I choose to connect everything together. 

You might find more detiles about how to make it all work in this article -> [fill missign]


### Prerequisites

#### Adafruit 

1. Create a free account at [Adafruit IO](https://accounts.adafruit.com/users/sign_in).
2. Create a new feed:
    - Turn Feed History off.
    - Remember it's name.
3. Generate an Adafruit IO Key   

#### IFTTT

1. Create a free account at [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com).
2. Create at least 3 applets trigged by Google Assistant, which sends data to Adafruit:
    - For starting playing a music video.
    - For stopping a music video.
    - For displaying the jukebox available songs

Again, to see an exaple check this article -> [fill missign].


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OrrMatzkin/jukebox-io-adafruit.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip3 install python-vlc
   pip3 install pip install adafruit-io
   ```
3. Enter your Adafruit details in `adafruit_config.json`
   ```json
    "ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY": "<YOUR ADAFRUIT IO KEY>",
    "ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME": "<YOUR ADAFRUIT IO USERNAME>",
    "AIO_FEED_ID": "<YOUR ADAFRUIT IO FEED NAME>" 
   ```
4. Make sure your device (Raspberry pi) is connected to a monitor and a set of speakers.


### Run Locally

Go to the project directory

```bash
 cd jukebox-io-adafruit
```

Start the the program

```bash
 python3 jukebox.py
```

To add a new song follow this steps:

1. Download your favorite music video. *
2. Rename the file to "\<Artist Name\> - \<Song Name\>.\<FIle Format\>" (see exmaple above).
4. Move the file to the `songs` directory.
3. Add the song details in `songs_data.json`
   ```json
   {
        "id": 0,
        "name": "<Song Name>",
        "artist": "<Artist Name>",
        "path": "<Path to song fille>",
        "matches": ["<match1>", "<match2>", "<match3>", "<match4>",...]
